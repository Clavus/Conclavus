Conclavus - LÖVE framework
===================

Framework build on [LÖVE](https://www.love2d.org/) for making 2D games. Implements a variety of scripts and libaries from the LÖVE community. Mostly used as practice for building and managing my own tools. I still try to document it as if other people were to use it (ha, imagine that).
