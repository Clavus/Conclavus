Tags

Each commit can have multiple changelog entries in the following format: tag message. Each entry is divided by ;, so a single commit with multiple entries 
will be something like: tag1 message1; tag2 message2; tag3 message3. A message is the text that will be printed on the changelog. A tag is a special code 
that helps divide changelog entries as well as control the versioning system. Available tags are:
